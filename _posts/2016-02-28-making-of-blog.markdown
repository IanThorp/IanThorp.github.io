Making a personal website has been an eye opening expeirence. I have learned so much through a task that I always thought was so simple. I learned a lot about two very important topics, CSS and HTML. These are super important for building most everything on the web, and making a website from scratch was the perfect way to get a quick intro into them.

Heck, I learned even more than just HTML and CSS. I learned how to manipulate my page using JavaScript!  It is great to get an idea of how webpages work on the insided. Otherwise though, I have really learned how difficult design is. It takes constant tweaking and lots of work to get a website looking just right. Than you can do it all over again with a new feature.

Even going through the process of acquiring a domain and hosting a website was a bit more complicated than I expected. I am about halfway through the process now. With any luck, you will be viewing this website somewhere other than github pages very very soon.

Well, this is the last post before I hit the books (or monitor) hard in person at Dev Bootcamp. I will be sure to keep updating as I progess!
