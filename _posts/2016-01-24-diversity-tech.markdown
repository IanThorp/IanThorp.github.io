Diversity in tech is a huge issue today. There are many reasons woman and minorities are not equally represented in a white male dominated tech industry, and maybe even a solution or two out there. One of the big reasons is the culture of tech as a whole.

Much of the big guys in tech do not have very good stats when it comes to equal hiring in the workplace. Out of Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Intel, the highest percentage of women in the work force was 37 percent with Amazon leading the way. If 37 percent is the highest, we have a long way to go. Ethnic diversity is even lower with only 15 percent African American employees at Amazon and a whopping 1 percent and 2 percent at Facebook and Google respectively. Asian is around 23 percent for all companies combined.

The numbers for leadership get even worse. Facebook leads the pack with 23 percent of its leadership being women. Microsoft trails in the back with only 13 percent of their leadership being women. All in all, the big tech companies average out at 79 percent of leadership being white. That does not promote much diversity.

But "what can be done?" you may ask. There are definitely some basic steps that can be taken to improve leadership diversity and therefore, I believe, improve diversity in the bulk of the tech industry. Leadership training programs are so so important to making people interested in and capable of handling those leadership roles. People in the current leadership need to be able to lay out plans and give advice to minorities and women in how to reach these high up positions. This will hopefully trickle down into more diversity being interested and hired.
