1. What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
  Using all of these elements helps to position your page perfectly. I used padding and borders together the most to creat a solid lines across the page to divide sections.

2. What did you learn about CSS positioning?
  CSS positioning is ridiculously hard and finnicky. I am sure this is something that gets easier with time, but to get a page looking perfect on all screens is very tough. It is something I look forward to getting better at.

3. What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
  Easiest to implement was changing all of my colors to fit my scheme. Pretty simple commands to get it all working. Toughest was definitely getting everything positioned just right and still working well when I resized the window.

4. What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
  There is a ridiculous number of different elements that can be used for every little detail. I will need to keep some cheatsheets handy to remember everthing.
