I should probably start with where it all began. Living in Salinas Valley was definitley a good way to grow up. Lots of farmland and that is about it. In fact, I come from a family of five generations of farmers. My dad and brothers are still in the farming business, and I definitely had my fair share of expierence raising animals and vegetables as a kid. As I neared the end of my highschool career, college was in my sights.

San Jose was the closest "big" city to me, and also had a pretty decent school. I applied, got accepted, and started my first semester as a mechanical engineering student. After years of changing majors, not exactly sure where I was headed, I ended up dropping out. I just had no idea what I wanted to do with myself. I ended up working as a tech for woodworking and metalworking machinery during the day, and a cocktail bartender at night. Lots of fun was had, but it was time to move on to something a little more challenging. These expierences were not all bad though. These jobs helped me develop my interests in DIY, from cutting steel with waterjets to programming arduino. I also grew a much better pallete and a great appreciation for craft cocktails and high quality Bourbons and Ryes.

Here I am today. Currently a student at Dev Bootcamp. Persuing my interests in programming that originally started with making a little LED blink on and off. I someday hope to have enough land to raise a few pigs. Not only are they the best pets I have every had, they also taste delicious.
