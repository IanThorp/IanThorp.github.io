        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          I should probably start with where it all began. Living in Salinas Valley was definitley a good way to grow up. Lots of farmland and that is about it. In fact, I come from a family of five generations of farmers. My dad and brothers are still in the farming business, and I definitely had my fair share of expierence raising animals and vegetables as a kid. As I neared the end of my highschool career, college was in my sights.

          San Jose was the closest "big" city to me, and also had a pretty decent school. I applied, got accepted, and started my first semester as a mechanical engineering student. After years of changing majors, not exactly sure where I was headed, I ended up dropping out. I just had no idea what I wanted to do with myself. I ended up working as a tech for woodworking and metalworking machinery during the day, and a cocktail bartender at night. Lots of fun was had, but it was time to move on to something a little more challenging.  These expierences were not all bad though. These jobs helped me develop my interests in DIY from cutting steel with waterjets to programming arduino. I also grew a much better pallete and a great appreciation for craft cocktails and high quality Bourbons and Ryes.

          Here I am today. Currently a student at Dev Bootcamp. Persuing my interests in programming that originally started with making a little LED blink on and off.  I someday hope to have enough land raise a few pigs. Not only are they the best pets I have every had, they also taste delicious.

<!--
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  It was a good expierence. We got to talk a bit about what makes a good website. I definitely pulled a from design ideas from my partner.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  Yes, wireframing definitely helped me visualize the website. I would have coded a completely different template if I did not wire frame first, and would not have been very happy with the results.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
  Attractive design and ease of finding links was very important. Putting the article at the right place so your eyes draw to it was very  important for us.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
  My partner suffested suggested we use a footer element.  Although not a super unique element, it works perfectly for the application I used it for in the template.
  I also learned the break element. I can see that element coming in handy a lot.
