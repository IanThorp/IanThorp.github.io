        <p>The topic of today is margins, borders, and padding. All of these elements have a very important place in positioning your content. Basically, these will help you determine where each piece of information on your page will go. Take a look at this picture to get a rough idea.

        <p>We will start going from the outside all the way in. The margin plays a big factor in the white space between one element and the next. The main thing to know about this is that it lives outside of the border.
        </p>
        <p>The border seperates the padding and the margin. This can have a size of zero, be invisible, or have color and texture. This is great for outlining any element you have.
        </p>
        <p>The padding lives closest to your actual element. This, similar to the margin, is also white space. The main difference between them is that this lives inside of the border.
        </p>
        <p>Using all three of these properties greatly helps to create elements with the proper spacing, or lack there of. Happy Coding!

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  It was a good expierence. We got to talk a bit about what makes a good website. I definitely pulled a from design ideas from my partner.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  Yes, wireframing definitely helped me visualize the website. I would have coded a completely different template if I did not wire frame first, and would not have been very happy with the results.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
  Attractive design and ease of finding links was very important. Putting the article at the right place so your eyes draw to it was very  important for us.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
  My partner suffested suggested we use a footer element.  Although not a super unique element, it works perfectly for the application I used it for in the template.
  I also learned the break element. I can see that element coming in handy a lot.
