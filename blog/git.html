    <h1>Version Control</h1>
    <h2>What is version control, and why does it help with software developement</h2>
    <h4>December 31, 2015</h4>

      <p>
      Version control is one of the first things any budding developer should learn. This will basically save multiple copies of your project at multiple checkpoints, and have them accesible to roll back to if you accidentally put in some incorrect code. Version control is great for a whole mess of other reasons too, like easy collaboration, and good tracking.
      </p>
      <p>
        The specific version control we are working with is git. Git works on the idea of branches coming off of one master file. These branches can be seen as almost parallel universes where the code takes a different direction without affecting the main master file. If you find that you like any of these directions, you can merge them back into the main file. With this, git keeps track of all of these changes for you. Whenever you have a section of code you like, you can "commit" that code to the branch. When this code was committed, who committed it, and why they committed it is all recorded. If any of these new commits ever fail you, you can always roll back to an older version or different branch of code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, as developers, we of course want to collaborate with others. Often times, we won't be able to simply use the same computer, or directly email updates to all of our partners. This is where Github comes in. Github allows us to have all of our code in the cloud, accesible by anyone we want at anytime, even simultaneously. Once any of these individuals is happy with their code, they can upload it to Github.  These changes must now be reviewed by someone else, before they merge back in with your master copy of the code. Safeties like this help protect the code from bugs being introduced on accident, but still allow relatively natural and easy co-working.
