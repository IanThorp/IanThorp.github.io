      <h2>Cycle: Using Enumerables and Enumerators</h2>
      <h3>01/31/2016</h3>

        <p>
          The words enumerables and enumerators may be words that you have never heard before. If you are not into programming or math, there is a good chance you are not familar with them. Basically, an Enumerator is a method that will go over each element of a enumerable, one at a time. Enumerables that you are using will often be arrays or hashes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, there are many different enumerable methods out there. <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/">Ruby-docs</a> is a great place to check all of these out and learn exactly how to implement them. Today, I will go over one of my favorites, called the cycle method.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cycle is a method that can definitely save you some time and help make code DRY.  Before I found this method, I was using a counter variable to actually keep track of how many times I performed a method on an array or hash. Although this worked, it definitely was not the cleanest way to write the code. With cycle, you will need an n value, an object, and a code block.
        </p>
        <h4>cycle(n){ |obj| block }</h4>
        <p>
          This will call the block for each and every element of the enumerable "n" times. Now, optionally you can leave the "n" blank, and this will repeat the block on every element infinitely. If you are not careful with this, you can create an infinite loop. View some examples below.
        </p>
        <code>array = ["one", "two", 3]</code>
        <br>
        <code>array.cycle { |i| puts i}</code>
        <br>
        <code>array.cycle(2) { |i| puts i}</code>

        <p>
            The first cycle will print out "one","two", 3 ... infinitely. The second cycle will print out the same, but only twice. This brings you a total of 6 elements executed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now go forth and have fun with enumberables. There are a multitude of things you can do with these fancy methods, and they definitely make you job as a developer a bit easier and a bit cleaner.

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  It was a good expierence. We got to talk a bit about what makes a good website. I definitely pulled a from design ideas from my partner.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  Yes, wireframing definitely helped me visualize the website. I would have coded a completely different template if I did not wire frame first, and would not have been very happy with the results.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
  Attractive design and ease of finding links was very important. Putting the article at the right place so your eyes draw to it was very  important for us.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
  My partner suffested suggested we use a footer element.  Although not a super unique element, it works perfectly for the application I used it for in the template.
  I also learned the break element. I can see that element coming in handy a lot.
