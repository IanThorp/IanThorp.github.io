      <h2>How Does the Internet Work?</h2>

        The internet. A series of tubes some say. Very complex regardless. But the big question is, just how does the damn thing work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The internet is basically a process for sending data between two computers. It actually uses lots of computers in between to help transfer these packets. No one is actually in charge of the internet. No one really runs it. It is run by everyone using it. All of us doing a small part.
        </p>
        <p>
          Basically, we are sending and recieving lots and lots of data packets over and over again. Regardless of how it works, I think this internet thing is really going to catch on.

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  It was a good expierence. We got to talk a bit about what makes a good website. I definitely pulled a from design ideas from my partner.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  Yes, wireframing definitely helped me visualize the website. I would have coded a completely different template if I did not wire frame first, and would not have been very happy with the results.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
  Attractive design and ease of finding links was very important. Putting the article at the right place so your eyes draw to it was very  important for us.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
  My partner suffested suggested we use a footer element.  Although not a super unique element, it works perfectly for the application I used it for in the template.
  I also learned the break element. I can see that element coming in handy a lot.
